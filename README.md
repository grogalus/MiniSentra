# ðŸ“¦ Sentra Scanner

Sentra Scanner is an AWS Lambda function that scans S3 buckets in your AWS account for specific patterns (e.g., email addresses) and sends the results to an Amazon SQS queue for downstream processing.

   - An event (e.g., "S3 Notification") cab trigger the Lambda function automaticlly (need to be configured manually as this time)
3. **Lambda (Sentra Scanner)**: Downloads the file, scans for matches (e.g., email addresses), and sends results.
4. **SQS Queue**: Collects results for downstream consumption or processing.
